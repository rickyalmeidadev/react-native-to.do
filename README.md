## About the project

The project consists of carrying out the challenge proposed by the Ignite Bootcamp course to create an application for managing tasks, with the possibilities of including a task, marking it as done, and deleting it.

In this challenge, I avoided using the template suggested by the course so that the project was created from scratch, thus giving me the freedom to build the [layout](https://www.figma.com/file/L442P4syOkbHGaLr4fGad4/to.do/duplicate).

## Built with
